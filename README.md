# InterviewProjectCalendar
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6.

The goal of this PROJECT is to create a demo calendar application using Angular WITHOUT using a `calendar` library.

## Instructions
Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies of the project.

After that Run `npm run start` for a dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## What I could improve on the code given more time

-- Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.

-- Create a backend server on Nodejs to persits the events.

-- Improve the UI / UX.





## Development server
Run `npm run start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
